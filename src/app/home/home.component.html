    Aaron Hunt has spent several years surveying the moths of Block Island, Rhode Island. His official species list currently sits at exactly 1000; this includes some species found on older surveys on the island but excludes a number of unidentified species. Aaron has sampled at locations throughout the island with the goal of determining species abundance, local distribution, and flight times. This website serves as a comprehensive guide to the islandâ€™s moths based on his research.
